# Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94 </h1>

#### Project goal:
This project aims to determine major indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. These indicators can be weather types (such as rain, snow) or time (like month, day, or hour), etc.

#### Dataset:
The traffic data was collected by a station located approximately midway between Minneapolis and Saint Paul. It was mentioned that they recorded westbound traffic (cars moving from east to west) from 2012-2018, so the result of our analysis will be about the westbound traffic only instead of the entire I-94 highway.
